Learning to build a repository

Hi, there! My name is Abhinav Duggal, and I am pursuing computer engineering from Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India. My hobbies include Machine Learning, Android, Coding, and gaining other skills which make me a better engineer, ready to face the world. Most of all, I know I put my heart and soul in any work that I undertake, so I will always be productive to the company, and though every person writes stuff like this to impress companies(atleast they think they do) but only some actually want to do it, and I believe that the company will know which ones are the hardowrking ones, and which ones the frauds, by the amount of work they are doing in a particular field, showing their dedication towards their current projects.
