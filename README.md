Learning to build a repository

Hi, there! My name is Abhinav Duggal, and I am pursuing computer engineering from Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India. My hobbies include Machine Learning, Android, Coding, and gaining other skills which make me a better engineer, ready to face the world. Most of all, I know I put my heart and soul in any work that I undertake, so I will always be productive to the company. Though every person writes stuff like this to impress companies(they think they do) but only some actually want to do it, and I believe that the company will know which ones are the hardworking ones, and which ones are not, by the amount as well as quality of work they are doing in a particular field, clearly showing their dedication towards their current projects.
